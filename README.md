# Shamir's Secret Sharing

![Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png) <!-- Replace with a relevant image link -->

## Overview

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm designed to securely share a secret among a group of participants. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of participants come together. This project provides a simplified implementation of the Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, focusing on polynomial interpolation and decoding values.

## Features

- **Polynomial Interpolation**: Utilizes Lagrange interpolation to compute the secret.
- **Decoding Values**: Supports decoding of values based on different number bases.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies imposter points that do not fit the polynomial curve.
- **Custom Input**: Allows users to input their own test cases.

## Getting Started
